# feature-request.md

Based on your current implementation in ServiceWorkerDebugPanel.tsx and the service worker files, I can suggest several useful features that could enhance your application:

Cache Management:

Add a cache cleanup/purge feature in the debug panel
Implement cache size limits and automatic pruning
Add cache versioning and selective cache invalidation
Display detailed cache contents in the debug panel
Background Sync:

Implement offline form submission with background sync
Add offline video/image upload capability
Queue failed API requests for retry when online
Show pending background sync tasks in the debug panel
Push Notifications:

Add push notification subscription management
Implement notification preferences (types, frequency)
Show notification history in the debug panel
Add scheduled/periodic notifications
Performance Enhancements:

Add resource preloading based on user behavior
Implement adaptive caching strategies based on network conditions
Add request prioritization
Show detailed performance metrics including:
Request timing breakdown
Cache hit ratio over time
Bandwidth savings
Load time improvements
Advanced Network Features:

Add bandwidth throttling simulation
Implement request prioritization
Add custom response delay simulation
Implement selective request blocking
Add custom error response simulation
Workbox Integration:

Add precaching for critical assets
Implement route-specific caching strategies
Add Google Analytics offline support
Add broadcast updates for cache updates
Debug Panel Enhancements:

Add real-time streaming logs
Implement log filtering and search
Add export/import of service worker configuration
Add visual graphs for performance metrics
Would you like me to help implement any of these features? I can provide specific code changes for the one you're most interested in.

For example, we could start with enhancing the cache management features by adding a new tab to your debug panel that shows cache contents and allows manual cache management. Or we could implement the push notification system if that's more aligned with your needs.
